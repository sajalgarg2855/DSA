Day-2 !!

Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into Time Complexity and Space Complexity, understanding how efficient different algorithms can be. Itâ€™s fascinating to see how small optimizations can make a huge difference in execution time!
Alongside that, Iâ€™ve been working on pattern-solving using loops, sharpening my logic and implementation skills. From simple triangles to complex pyramids, every pattern teaches something new about iteration and nested loops.
Competitive Programming is a marathon, not a sprint, and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and improving! ðŸ’¡ðŸ’»
