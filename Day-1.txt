Day 1
Revisiting the Basics of C++ ðŸš€
Today marks the first step in my journey of mastering C++ for Competitive Programming and Data Structures & Algorithms! ðŸ”¥
I spent the day revisiting the fundamentals:
âœ… Data Types & Variables
âœ… Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)
âœ… Loops (for, while, do-while)
âœ… Functions & Scope
âœ… Arrays & Basic Input/Output
Itâ€™s amazing how revisiting the basics with a fresh perspective builds a strong foundation for more advanced problem-solving! Looking forward to diving deeper into algorithms and optimization.
